		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>Assam tea is a black tea named after Assam, India, the region of its production. The Assam tea plant is indigenous to Assamâ€”initial efforts to plant the Chinese varieties in Assam soil did not succeed. Assam tea is now mostly grown at or near sea level and is known for its body, briskness, malty flavour, and strong, bright colour. Assam teas, or blends containing Assam tea, are often sold as "breakfast" teas. For instance, Irish breakfast tea, a maltier and stronger breakfast tea, consists of small-sized Assam tea leaves.</p>
